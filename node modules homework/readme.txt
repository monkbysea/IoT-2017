Hi Ayo,
I used readline and write modules to finish the homework on desktop, i had trouble installing nom on my raspberry pi. Node seems to be installed successfully cuz i can check the version by using the “node -v” command, but when i typed in “npm -v”, it gives me error. I also tried redoing the node installation following the process on the slide, and it gave me error too.I even went to download node linux package directly from raspberry pi. Then i also tried unsinstalling node by trying to manually delete the node files following some instructions online, but nothing worked. I’ll keep trying and for the purpose of the homework, i’ll just give you what I have. Thank you!
